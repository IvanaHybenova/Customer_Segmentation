  In the mall there are all sorts of decisions that have to be made. Among them there are some that directly effect the customer experience.
  It is for example the product selection, its organization in the mall, prices. So far, the only way we measure how good we are in doing these decisions is monthly revenue.
  But our mission is to build stable and happy customer base with great customer experience, which were among the main reasons of providing membership in the first place.  

  Since we don‘t know who our customers are, we currently have general marketing. Everybody are getting the very same emails and flyers about discounts or seasonal products in the mall etc.  
  Our marketing is not personalized in any way.

  Customer experience department is in close collaboration with marketing department and they are supposed to make sure that each of our customers finds in our store almost everything, 
  he/she might desire and that the whole experience in our store is as pleasant as possible. Without knowing our customer base, we treat every customer the same way.
  Now I am talking about the online questionnaires, content and frequency of the emails etc.  

  One of the main metrices we came up with to measure the „customer success“ was the spending score. We did our best to implement in the calculation all the features that might play
  a role in the customer behavior, so the customers with annual income 40K are not expected to spend as much as customers with annual income 80K etc.  

  We know that the spending score differs from customer to customer and the customer segmentation might help us to group the customers, understand which segments have low spending score
  and features of these segments might imply what could be possible improvements to make the customers satisfied and loyal.
